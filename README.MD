# Java Reflection Event System

This library allow you to write your application under an event driven architecture in a easy and beautiful way.

# How does it works?

### Code is controlled by event handlers, not by manual function calls.

These event handlers can be plugged or unplugged at any time without having to change nothing from the original code.
